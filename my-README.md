Started during lunch break.
+25m 
Got HTML marked up with classes and added img.
*may* need additional div in the top section 
to make grid layout work for desktop, but
doing mobile first.

Up next is basic CSS.
Last task I didn't use custom properties / CSS variables.
Keen to give those a go this time. Will try and get this
happening for:
- colours,
- font,
- font weights.

6:10 pm Spent 20m mucking around
w custom properties after work.
Now have
- colours,
- font,
- font weights.
all working. Nice! 👍.

Just got it setup on gitHub.

last night + 2hrs
fixed first input field.
Note - needed it's own grid.
1 cell to hold the '$', one for the input. 
Will use 'text' type as I don't
want increment arrows added byt
the browser on the field.
Unless I can get rid of them?
Override maybe.

6:28 am
+20m correctly styled second field.
Corrected font weight for input field.
Still todo
➤ fix number increment arrows from auto
matically appearing on input fields
➤ reduce padding left on input numbers.
➤ will need to use JS regex to add a comma
after every 4th digit gets added to an
input. i.e.
900 👍
but
1,900 👍.
➤ Also noticed formatting for 'years'
text breaks on firefox, but fine elsewhere. - will also need fixing.
I checked, and it isn't to do with
overriding the number input arrows.

Have an issue where my mortgage term field looks ok
in all browsers but breaks on my mob.
On the above codepen i managed to make a simple
styled field in the style I'm going for that looks ok
without the bg colour poking out.
That codepen looks good on mob too.
I'll try that simpler styling out next on my buttons and see if I can clean up the css a bit.

They look alright. Starting on calculate button now.

Have got calc button looking good in it's base state.
Noticed I now need to either *increase* the result img
that sits below the form to match the design, or
I think better - 
>> reduce the form width slightly to give it ≈1rem
padding on either side to sit more narrow than the image
below.
