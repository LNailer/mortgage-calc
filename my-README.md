Started during lunch break.
+25m 
Got HTML marked up with classes and added img.
*may* need additional div in the top section 
to make grid layout work for desktop, but
doing mobile first.

Up next is basic CSS.
Last task I didn't use custom properties / CSS variables.
Keen to give those a go this time. Will try and get this
happening for:
- colours,
- font,
- font weights.

6:10 pm Spent 20m mucking around
w custom properties after work.
Now have
- colours,
- font,
- font weights.
all working. Nice! üëç.
